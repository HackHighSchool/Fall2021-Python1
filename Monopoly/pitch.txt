Monopoly Game Pitch
______________

We plan to develop a console-central, input-based Monopoly game based on the popular board game.
Accordingly, we have constructed our ideas for the core operations, objective and game loop.
This project will implement concepts in basic python, data structures and object-oriented programming.
In this semester, we will attempt to get our text-based game on the ground. Next semester, we will try to develop a game with full graphics.

1. Multiple Players on the Same Computer
    - Potential Option for Player v. Computer or Player v. Player
    - Players will be be represented as objects within the game
    - Players provided with a standard amount of money

2. "Game Board" consisting of various "properties"
    - Set number of squares on the board
    - Represented as objects within the game
    - Random Number Generator As Dice

3. Non Property-Related Different Operations
    - Go to Jail
    - Community Chest/Chance Cards

4. GAME LOOP
    - Each player starts at the same point
    - In order, players roll dice and move forward with the given distance
    - Taken to a certain position/property
        - Passing go -> earn $200
    - Given option to buy it, or pay rent if somebody owns it
    - Users can also potentially pick up miscellaneous cards (section 6)
    - If player owns all properties, option to place houses
    - If player has all the houses on a property, they can place a hotel
    - If a player runs out of money, they can mortgage their properties
    - Game continues until there is a winner (everyone else is bankrupt)
